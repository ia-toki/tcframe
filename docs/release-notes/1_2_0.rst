.. _v1_2_0:

1.2.0
=====

December 16, 2016

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed a regression when the final verdict of local grading of problems without subtasks is always AC.

New features
------------

- It is now possible to write a custom program that checks whether the contestant's output is correct (instead of just comparing it with the official output). This is called custom scorer program.
- It is now possible not to generate test case output (``.out``) files.

See :ref:`styles` for details on how to enable the above options.
