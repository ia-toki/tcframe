# 1.6.0

September 17, 2017

## Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where TCFrame crashed when grading spec with multiple test cases mode, which has no sample test cases.
- Fixed a bug where a `LINE()` with only jagged vector contained an extra leading space.
- Fixed a bug where a `LINES()` with empty vectors contained extra spaces.

## Enhancements

- Disallow specifying `SIZE()` after `LINE()` and `RAW_LINE()` instead of silently ignoring it.
