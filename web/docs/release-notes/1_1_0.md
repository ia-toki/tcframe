# 1.1.0

December 4, 2016

New features
------------

- It is now possible to omit `SIZE()` for a `LINES()` segment, as long as it is the last segment in an I/O format.
- Brand new segments: `RAW_LINE()` and `RAW_LINES()`, which accept strings containing whitespaces.

## Enhancements

- I/O format errors after a vector/matrix now have the last indices reported in the error message. For example,

    Before:
    ```
    Expected: <newline> after 'D'
    ```

    Now:
    ```
    Expected: <newline> after 'D[1]'
    ```
