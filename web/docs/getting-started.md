# Getting Started

In TCFrame world, a problem is defined by a **problem package**, which consists of a **spec file** and one or more solution files. The spec file is then compiled into a **runner program**. The runner program together with the compiled solution files can then generate test cases for the problem.

Let's write our first problem package! We are going to write a package for the following infamous "A+B" problem:

> **A+B Problem**
>
> Time Limit: 1 second
>
> Memory Limit: 64 MB
>
> **Description**
>
> You are given two integers A and B. Compute the sum of them!
>
> **Input Format**
>
> A single line containing two space-separated integers A and B.
>
> **Output Format**
>
> A single line containing the required sum.
>
> **Sample Input**
>
> ```
> 4 6
> ```
>
> **Sample Output**
>
> ```
> 10
> ```
>
> **Constraints**
>
> - 1 ≤ A ≤ 1,000
> - 1 ≤ B ≤ 1,000

:::info[Note]

This starter guide will just demonstrate the basic features of TCFrame. For more advanced features, please consult the [Topic Guides](./topic-guides) afterwards.

:::

## Installing TCFrame

See the [Installation documentation](./installation).

## Preparing package directory

Create a directory called `sum` somewhere. This will be our package directory for this A+B problem. Store all the files you will be creating on this guide in this directory.

## Writing solution file

In order to be able to generate the test case output files, a reference solution must be available. For the purpose of this guide, call the solution file `solution.cpp`. Example solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int A, B;
    cin >> A >> B;
    cout << (A + B) << endl;
}
```

Then, compile it to `solution` executable, for example:

```
g++ -o solution solution.cpp
```

## Writing spec file

A spec file contains problem spec and test spec.

Create a C++ source file called `spec.cpp`. Copy-paste the following code to the file:

```cpp
#include <tcframe/spec.hpp>
using namespace tcframe;

class ProblemSpec : public BaseProblemSpec {
protected:
    int A, B;
    int sum;

    void InputFormat() {
        LINE(A, B);
    }

    void OutputFormat() {
        LINE(sum);
    }

    void GradingConfig() {
        TimeLimit(1);
        MemoryLimit(64);
    }

    void Constraints() {
        CONS(1 <= A && A <= 1000);
        CONS(1 <= B && B <= 1000);
    }
};

class TestSpec : public BaseTestSpec<ProblemSpec> {
protected:
    void SampleTestCase1() {
        Input({
            "4 6"
        });
        Output({
            "10"
        });
    }

    void TestCases() {
        CASE(A = 1, B = 1);
        CASE(A = 1000, B = 1000);
        CASE(A = 42, B = 100);
        CASE(A = rnd.nextInt(1, 1000), B = rnd.nextInt(1, 1000));
    }
};
```

We will explain this spec file in more details later -- keep going!

## Building runner program

Next, we will compile this spec file into what we call a **runner program**. We will use the `tcframe` command. Simply run this in the `sum` directory:

```
tcframe build
```

This will compile ``spec.cpp`` into ``runner``. Make sure that it compiles before continuing this getting started guide!

Finally, run the runner program:

```
./runner
```

If everything is OK, you should get the following output:

```
Generating test cases...

[ SAMPLE TEST CASES ]
  sum_sample_1: OK

[ OFFICIAL TEST CASES ]
  sum_1: OK
  sum_2: OK
  sum_3: OK
  sum_4: OK

Generation finished. All test cases OK.
```

Congratulations, you have just written your first problem package using TCFrame framework! Now, check out your `sum/tc` directory -- it will contain the generated test case files.

## Inspecting problem package

We will now examine each component of a problem package in more details.

### Slug

A slug is a unique name/codename/identifier for the problem. It is taken from name of the problem package directory. Since we call our problem package directory `sum`, the slug of our example problem is `sum`.

### Spec file

A spec file is a C++ source file called `spec.cpp` that lives inside the problem package directory.

### tcframe header

```cpp
#include <tcframe/spec.hpp>
using namespace tcframe;
```

`tcframe/spec.hpp` is the main TCFrame's header file for spec files. Each component of TCFrame lives in the `tcframe` namespace, just like the STL functions that live in the `std` namespace. By importing the namespace, we don't have to explicitly prefix each class/object we want to use with `tcframe::`.

### Problem spec class

```cpp
class ProblemSpec : public BaseProblemSpec {
protected:
    ...
};
```

A **problem spec** class is where we define the I/O formats, constraints, and some configurations of our problem. This class must inherit `tcframe::BaseProblemSpec`, and must be called `ProblemSpec`.

All required members of this class must go in the **protected** section.

### Grading configuration

```cpp
void GradingConfig() {
    TimeLimit(1);
    MemoryLimit(64);
}
```

Quite self-explanatory. This has actually no effect during test cases generation, and will affect local grading as explained in later section of this guide. If not specified, the default time limit is 2 seconds, and the default memory limit is 64 megabytes.

### Input/output variables and formats

```cpp
int A, B;
int sum;

void InputFormat() {
    LINE(A, B);
}

void OutputFormat() {
    LINE(sum);
}
```

Next, we defined the input and output variables and formats. The input consists of two values: **A** and **B**. The output consists of one value; let's call it **sum**. We must declare a variable for each of those values, and then tell TCFrame how to format them in the input/output files.

Here, we declared two integers `A` and `B` as **input variables**, and an integer `sum` as an **output variable**. `InputFormat()` and `OutputFormat()` methods specify the input/output formats in terms of the input/output variables. The `LINE()` macro here specifies a line consisting of space-separated values of the given arguments.

### Constraints

```cpp
void Constraints() {
    CONS(1 <= A && A <= 1000);
    CONS(1 <= B && B <= 1000);
}
```

The last part of a problem spec is **constraints** specification.

A constraint must depend on input variables **only**. Each constraint can be specified as a boolean predicate inside the `CONS()` macro.

Here, we have two constraints, which are just direct translations of what we have in the problem statement.

----

We now have a formal specification of our A+B problem. The next part is writing a test spec that specifies test cases which conform to the problem spec.

### Test spec class

```cpp
class TestSpec : public BaseTestSpec<ProblemSpec> {
protected:
    ...
};
```

A **test spec** is a class that inherits `tcframe::BaseTestSpec<T>`, where `T` is the problem spec class. It must be called `TestSpec`.

This is where we actually write the test case definitions.

### Test case definitions

```cpp
void SampleTestCase1() {
    Input({
        "4 6"
    });
    Output({
        "10"
    });
}

void TestCases() {
    CASE(A = 1, B = 1);
    CASE(A = 1000, B = 1000);
    CASE(A = 42, B = 100);
    CASE(A = rnd.nextInt(1, 1000), B = rnd.nextInt(1, 1000));
}
```

Here, we finally defined the test cases (yeay!). For the purpose of this guide, we defined four test cases: 3 hand-made and 1 randomized. We also defined one sample test case that match with the one in the actual problem statement.

In TCFrame, sample test cases, if any, are defined in the `SampleTestCaseX()` methods, where `X` is the sample test case number. Each sample test case is defined as line-by-line verbatim strings in the `Input()` and `Output()` methods. Sample test cases must conform to the input format, or TCFrame will complain.

Test cases are defined in the `TestCases()` method. Each test case is defined by listing input variable assignments the `CASE()` macro, separated by commas. Here, we just defined a min case, max case, random hand-made case, and a randomized case. The last one is achieved using `tcframe::rnd`, a simple random number generator provided by TCFrame.

:::info[Note]

Yes, you can access the input variables directly inside the test spec, even though they are declared in the problem spec class!

:::

----

We've covered each component of our problem package in more details. Next, let's play around with our runner program.

### Trying out invalid test cases

What happens when we specify invalid test cases? Let's just try. Add this test case to our test spec:

```cpp
CASE(A = 0, B = 1);
```

and this sample test case:

```cpp
void SampleTestCase2() {
    Input({
        "1",
        "2"
    });
    Output({
        "3"
    });
}
```

Recompile (by running `tcframe build`) and rerun the runner program. You should now get the following output instead:

```
Generating test cases...

[ SAMPLE TEST CASES ]
    sum_sample_1: OK
    sum_sample_2: FAILED
    Reasons:
    * Expected: <space> after variable `A`

[ OFFICIAL TEST CASES ]
    sum_1: OK
    sum_2: OK
    sum_3: OK
    sum_4: OK
    sum_5: FAILED
    Description: A = 0, B = 1
    Reasons:
    * Does not satisfy constraints, on:
        - 1 <= A && A <= 1000

Generation finished. Some test cases FAILED.
```

Sweet! If we ever have invalid test cases, TCFrame will tell us in human-readable message.

Remove the invalid test cases and move on to the next section.

### Local grading

When preparing a problem, it's ideal if we have at least another solution as an alternative/secondary solution. TCFrame lets you "grade" another solution using the main solution as the reference. The time and memory limits from `GradingConfig()` as explained previously will be taken into consideration.

First, fix our spec file and re-run it to get back the correct test cases (important!). Then, write an alternate solution that deliberately behaves incorrectly on some test cases. Write the following as ``solution_alt.cpp``:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int A, B;
    cin >> A >> B;

    if (A == 1) {
        cout << 3 << endl;
    } else if (A == 1000) {
        while (true);
    } else if (A == 42) {
        return 1 / 0;
    } else {
        cout << (A + B) << endl;
    }
}
```

Compile the solution into `solution_alt` executable, and then run the following command:

```
./runner grade --solution=./solution_alt
```

The above command tells TCFrame to run the specified alternate solution command against the output files previously produced by the main solution.

You should get the following output:

```
Local grading with solution command: './solution_alt'...

[ SAMPLE TEST CASES ]
    sum_sample_1: Accepted

[ OFFICIAL TEST CASES ]
    sum_1: Wrong Answer
    * Diff:
(expected) [line 01]    2
(received) [line 01]    3

    sum_2: Time Limit Exceeded
    sum_3: Runtime Error
    * Execution of submission failed:
        - Floating point exception: 8
    sum_4: Accepted

[ VERDICT ]
    Time Limit Exceeded [25]
```

We get a detailed verdict of each test case. Nice, isn't it? The final result here is **Time Limit Exceeded**, which is the "worst" verdict among all test case verdicts, and we get 25 points because we get one test case correct out of all four test cases.
