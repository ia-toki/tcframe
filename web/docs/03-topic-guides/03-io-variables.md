# I/O variables

**Input variables** are C++ variables whose values compose test cases input files. They are are direct translations from variables mentioned in the problem statement's input format section into C++ variables. For example, given the following description:

> The first line contains two integers **N** and **K**. The second line contains **N** space-separated integers **A**[1], **A**[2], ..., **A**[**N**].

we will have three input variables: `int N`, `int K`, and `vector<int> A`.

Input variables are the **basic units** of computation in TCFrame. For example, they are manipulated in three different places:

- [Input format definition](./io-formats) in problem spec. It determines the layout of test case input files.
- [Constraint definitions](./constraints) in problem spec. They determine whether the values of input variables are valid.
- [Test case definitions](./test-cases) in test spec. Each of them determines the content of a single test case input file.

**Output variables** are defined in a similar way, the only difference being that they are just manipulated in output format definition. Also, usually they consist of just a single variable without name in the problem statement's output format. We can just name them `result` or something similar.

I/O variables are defined as protected member variables in the problem spec class. For example:

```cpp
class ProblemSpec : public BaseProblemSpec {
protected:
    int N, K;
    vector<int> A;

    string result;

    // the rest of problem spec components follow
};
```

## Supported I/O variable types

TCFrame supports three types of I/O variables as follows.

- **Scalar**
  
  Variables of built-in integral types (`int`, `long long`, `char`, etc.), built-in floating-point types (`float`, `double`), and `std::string`.

- **Vector**
  
  `std::vector<T>`, where `T` is a scalar type as defined above.

- **Matrix**
  
  `std::vector<std::vector<T>>`, where `T` is a scalar type as defined above.

Other types are not supported as I/O variables. TCFrame prefers STL types whenever possible. For example, `char*` is not supported as strings. Also, regular arrays (`T[]`) and 2D arrays (`T[][]`) are not supported.
