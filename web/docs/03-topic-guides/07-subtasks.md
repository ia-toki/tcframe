# Subtasks

The concept of **subtasks** was first formally introduced in IOI 2010. The idea is basically to split a problem into two or more smaller problems with gradually increasing difficulty, and assign them different points.

For example:

> **Subtask 1 (20 points)**
>
> - N = 1
> - 1 ≤ K ≤ 100
>
> **Subtask 2 (20 points)**
>
> - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
> - K = 1
>
> **Subtask 3 (60 points)**
>
> - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
> - 1 ≤ K ≤ 100

In this type of problem, you won't be writing a `Constraints()` method. Instead, you will be writing `SubtaskX()` methods, where `X` is the subtask number.

As of this version, you can define up to 25 subtasks: `Subtask1()` .. `Subtask25()`.

## Subtask definitions

A subtask is basically just a set of constraints. It can be specified by the method `SubtaskX()`, where `X` is the subtask number. Inside the method, the constraint specifications are given, similar to what you usually do in the `Constraints()` method. Points for each subtask can be given using `Points()` method, that takes a floating-point number argument as the points.

Thus, the above example can be implemented as:

```cpp
void Subtask1() {
    Points(20);

    CONS(N == 1);
    CONS(1 <= K && K <= 100);
}

void Subtask2() {
    Points(20);

    CONS(1 <= N && N <= 100);
    CONS(K == 1);
}

void Subtask3() {
    Points(60);

    CONS(1 <= N && N <= 100);
    CONS(1 <= K && K <= 100);
}
```

## Global constraints

It is possible to specify a set of constraints that apply to every subtask, via the `Constraints()` method. For example, we can extract common constraints in the above example as follows:

```cpp
void Constraints() {
    CONS(1 <= N && N <= 100);
    CONS(1 <= K && K <= 100);
}

void Subtask1() {
    Points(20);

    CONS(N == 1);
}

void Subtask2() {
    Points(20);

    CONS(K == 1);
}

void Subtask3() {
    Points(60);

    // no additional constraints
}
```

## Test groups

If your problem has subtasks, you will be writing [test groups](./test-groups), not test cases.
