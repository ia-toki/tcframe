# Problem package

A problem package is the unit of work in TCFrame that defines a problem and its test data. It is a directory that consists of all files related to the problem, particularly a spec file and one or more solution files. It is identified by a unique name called **slug**.

## Slug

A slug can be considered as the codename of a problem. For example, if your problem name is "Counting Tree", the slug could be `tree` or `counting-tree` or whatever you like, as long as it consists of one or more characters `a`-`z`, `A`-`Z`, `0`-`9`, and `-`. The produced test case files will have the slug as the prefix, for example: `tree_1.in`.

The slug will be taken from the name of the problem package's directory. For example, if your problem package directory is `/home/fushar/my-contest/tree/`, then the slug would be `tree`.

It is also possible to prepend the slug with some metadata string, separated by an underscore (`_`). For example, if `tree` if your third problem in your contest, you might want to call your problem package directory `/home/fushar/my-contest/c_tree/`. In this case, the slug would be still `tree`.

## Components of a problem package

- **[Spec file](./spec)**

    The formal specification of the problem.

- **Solution files**

    A reference solution and one or more alternate solutions to the problem.

- **[Evaluator helper files](./styles#helper-programs)**

    Optional, e.g. custom scorer and communicator.
