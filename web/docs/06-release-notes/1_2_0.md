# 1.2.0

December 16, 2016

## Bugfixes

- Fixed a regression when the final verdict of local grading of problems without subtasks is always AC.

## New features

- It is now possible to write a custom program that checks whether the contestant's output is correct (instead of just comparing it with the official output). This is called custom scorer program.
- It is now possible not to generate test case output (`.out`) files.

See [Problem styles](../topic-guides/styles) for details on how to enable the above options.
