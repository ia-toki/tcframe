# 1.2.1

January 29, 2017

## Bugfixes

- Fixed a regression when I/O format segments do not pick up correct sizes if the sizes contain expressions that contain I/O variables. The value of the variables were evaluated the first time they were read.

  For example, if you declare `SIZE(N - 1)`, it would always evaluate to `SIZE(-1)` (`N` = 0), which is incorrect. It is now fixed.

  Note that if the expression contains only a single variable (e.g. `SIZE(N)`), it is not affected and has always been correct.
